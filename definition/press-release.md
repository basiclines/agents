## Content guide

Generate a One Pager following Amazon’s “Working Backwards” methodology, structured exactly as indicated below:

[Title] (Clearly communicates the main benefit in a friendly and human tone)

[Subtitle] (Briefly lists relevant secondary benefits in an approachable and conversational manner)

[Pain/Problem] (Root cause of the problem, crafting a relatable narrative that resonates personally, rather than formally stating the issue.)

[Solution] (Simply and warmly describe how this solution concretely resolves the described problem, emphasizing benefits in everyday language without technical jargon.)

[Client Quote] (Create a short, friendly, first-person quote describing the real-life positive impact and feelings associated with experiencing the solution. Be specific—avoid vague or generic statements. Make it sound like something someone would actually say after solving this problem.)

[Features] (Mention specific features or details in a relatable way, clearly showing how each one makes life easier, happier, or better. Every feature should directly connect to a real-life benefit.)

[FAQ] (Include questions someone might genuinely ask in everyday conversation, followed by clear, friendly answers explaining exactly how this solution helps.)

## Writing style

* Real-life benefits: Ensure each benefit presented directly relates to everyday life, clearly addressing practical needs and genuine issues.

* Friendly and approachable: Write in a conversational, warm, and human tone. Avoid formal or impersonal language like “users,” “individuals,” or “consumers.”

* Clear and simple: Use clear, easy-to-understand language, free from unnecessary jargon or complexity.

* Evident value: After completion, make sure the real-life value and reason for choosing this solution are obvious and compelling.

* Emotional connection: Describe not just what the solution does, but how it makes someone feel happier, less stressed, or more confident.

* Storytelling flow: Ensure there’s a natural, engaging narrative flow from the problem to the solution.

* Use plain English: Avoid complex nouns and verbs. Choose words so simple that even someone who is not a native English speaker can understand the 
message easily.

* Stay grounded: Avoid over-narrating or exaggerating the problem, the solution, or the quote. Keep the tone natural, informal, and concise—like 
something you’d say to a friend in a casual conversation.

* Be specific in the quote: Avoid generic or templated phrases. Make the quote sound real, personal, and grounded in the actual experience of 
solving the problem.

* Introduce rythm, make different lenght phrases to engage the reader.
