# Historical Influences

Modern UI borrows heavily from decades of ideas and inventions. Knowing origins informs better decisions today.

- Radio Buttons & Checkboxes: Named after physical controls. Use radios for single choice in a set; checkboxes for independent toggles. Consistency preserves learned behavior.
- Evolution of Icons: From pixelated (Xerox Star) to skeuomorphic richness (90s/00s) to flat/minimal (2010s) and subtle depth today. Prioritize recognizable silhouettes and metaphors.
- Interface Metaphors & Skeuomorphism: Desktop, folders, trash can, toggles—real-world analogies that eased adoption. Break conventions only with clear benefits and teaching.
- Web History – Blue Links: Early browsers used blue/purple; convention stuck. If deviating, provide strong affordances (e.g., underline) for accessibility and recognition.
- OS Influences: Window controls, menus, scrollbars, dialog button order differ by platform. Respect platform norms (e.g., OK/Cancel order) or adapt per OS.
- Trend Cycles: Skeuomorphic → flat → layered hybrids (Material/Fluent). Be wary of low-contrast trends (e.g., neumorphism) that harm accessibility.

Leverage history’s lessons: use durable conventions for clarity; innovate intentionally, backed by rationale and testing.
