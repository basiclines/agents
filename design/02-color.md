# Color

Color in interface design is powerful: it grabs attention, conveys meaning, and evokes emotion. It’s also complex – our perception of color depends on both human biology and context. Here we cover key considerations for using color effectively in UX design:

- Color and Emotion: Each color carries psychological associations. For example, red often signals urgency or passion – it can evoke love and excitement but also anger or danger. Brands may use red to communicate warmth and energy. Blue is typically seen as trustworthy and calming; many tech and finance companies use blue to build user confidence. Yellow conveys cheerfulness and optimism. Green tends to signify growth, health, or tranquility. Colors can have different connotations across cultures and genders, but generally, leveraging these common associations can strengthen your design’s message. People form initial impressions of a product within seconds, and color heavily influences that assessment. Choose a palette that supports the mood and personality you want users to feel.
- Color Harmony and Schemes: A well-chosen color scheme creates visual cohesion. Use tools like the color wheel to select harmonious combinations. Analogous palettes (adjacent hues) often produce serene, unified looks; complementary pairs (opposites) yield vibrant contrast that makes key elements pop. Many designs combine neutral tones with one or two accent colors to maintain cleanliness while providing highlights. Define a primary color (often for calls-to-action) and a limited set of supporting colors. Avoid mixing too many hues randomly.
- Contrast for Readability: Sufficient contrast between text (or UI elements) and backgrounds is critical. Aim to meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG contrast ratios). Color perception is relative – always evaluate contrast in context and across themes. Consider color-blind users: avoid relying on color alone to denote state; add icons, patterns, or labels. Pay extra attention to dark mode, where traditional formulas can fall short; test thoroughly.
- Context and Perception: Human vision interprets color based on context and contrast. Simultaneous contrast can make a color appear lighter/darker depending on neighbors. Test colors together in situ. Remember additive light (screens) differs from pigments (print). Display technologies and color gamuts vary (sRGB vs P3), so verify critical visuals on multiple devices.
- Use Color with Purpose: Assign roles to colors in your design system. Use one consistent hue for primary actions, another for destructive, and another for informative states. Use saturated accents sparingly against neutral bases to maintain a strong signal-to-noise ratio. Test palettes for unintended cultural connotations and alignment with brand identity.
- Modern Trends – Gradients and Beyond: Gradients and vibrant multi-color schemes have returned. Ensure sufficient contrast if overlaying text; consider subtle overlays to improve legibility. Support dark mode with adjusted color values to avoid eye strain. Favor usability over novelty.

In summary, color is a high-impact tool that must be used thoughtfully. Select a coherent palette that reinforces brand and purpose, ensure sufficient contrast for readability, and leverage conventions to communicate meaning. Design for inclusivity by validating choices across contexts, devices, and user needs.
