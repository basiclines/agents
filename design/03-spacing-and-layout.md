# Spacing & Layout

Whitespace – often called negative space – is the unsung hero of interface design. Good use of spacing can make a UI feel open, easy to read, and organized, whereas poor spacing leads to clutter and confusion. Guidelines:

- Whitespace is Not Wasted Space: It gives breathing room to content. Generous padding and margins improve readability and usability. Start with more whitespace and condense only if necessary.
- Group Related Items with Proximity: Place related elements closer together and add extra space between unrelated groups. Use smaller internal spacing within a chunk and larger gaps between chunks to communicate hierarchy.
- Use a Grid System: Employ an 8pt spacing scale and a column grid (12 columns is common) to ensure alignment and consistency. Define standard spacing tokens (8, 16, 24, 32, etc.).
- Alignment and Consistency: Align elements to common rows/columns; misalignment creates visual tension. Use optical adjustments sparingly where geometric centering feels off.
- Avoid Tiny, Imperceptible Differences: Ensure spacing differences are meaningful. Limit spacing increments to create clear contrast.
- Leverage Other Cues in Dense Designs: When whitespace is constrained, use separators, background panels, typographic hierarchy, or subtle shadows to delineate groups.
- Responsive Spacing: Adapt spacing and grids at breakpoints; maintain comfortable touch targets and typographic rhythm across screen sizes.

Key Takeaway: Spacing and layout are foundational to visual clarity. Use structure and whitespace so interfaces are digestible and intuitively organized.
