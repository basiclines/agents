This guide is organized into chapters that summarize and operationalize Rob Fitzpatrick’s The Mom Test for rigorous customer discovery. Each chapter pairs core principles with practical tactics, examples, and field-ready prompts so you can run better conversations, avoid false positives, and turn feedback into clear next steps.

# Chapters
## 1) The Mom Test — Ask questions that reveal the truth
Introduces the 3 core rules for getting honest customer feedback (talk about their life, ask about past behavior, listen more than you speak) and shows how even your mom “lies” by being nice if you ask the wrong way.

## 2) Avoiding Bad Data
Explains common sources of misleading feedback—empty compliments, future hypotheticals, and unsolicited feature ideas—and how to deflect, anchor to specifics, and probe for underlying needs so you don’t fool yourself with fake validation.

## 3) Asking Important Questions
Shows how to identify your top risks and prepare the 3 most important questions before each conversation. Focus on what could change your plan (e.g., problem severity, budget, buying process) rather than trivia.

## 4) Keep It Casual
Why informal conversations beat formal interviews early on. Learn to seize spontaneous interactions, avoid zooming into your solution too soon, and reduce bias by keeping chats lightweight and natural.

## 5) Commitment & Advancement
Measure real interest by securing concrete commitments (time, reputation, money) and always leave with a next step. Convert nice words into actions—or discover disinterest quickly.

## 6) Finding Conversations
Tactics to get in front of potential customers: go to where they are (online/offline) and make them come to you (content, events, advisory flips). Turn cold outreach into warm referrals.

## 7) Choosing Your Customers
Pick a specific, reachable, homogeneous segment first. Avoid drowning in conflicting feedback; focus on a niche with real pain and clear access, then expand adjacently.

## 8) Running the Process
Tie it all together: prep, execute, follow up. A lightweight operating cadence for notes, team debriefs, hypothesis updates, and continuous iteration from conversation to decision.
