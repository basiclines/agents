# Chapter 4: Keep It Casual

One of The Mom Test’s surprising lessons: early on, don’t over-formalize customer interviews. The best discovery often feels like a casual chat, not a formal interview. Informality reduces bias and defensiveness for both sides.

Formal meetings create problems:

- Expectations and pressure rise. Prospects expect a polished pitch or to “do you a favor,” so they default to polite, politically correct answers.
- Logistics waste time. Scheduling an hour might take weeks. The real cost of a 1-hour meeting can be 4 hours across coordination and prep.
- Premature solution zoom. Formal settings nudge you to present your solution too early, biasing the rest of the conversation.

Keeping it casual works better:

- Don’t ask for heavy meetings unless needed. Favor quick, opportunistic chats: “Do you have 5 minutes now? I’d love to understand how you handle X.” Five minutes often becomes fifteen naturally and yields more honest insights.
- Embed questions in everyday interactions. At events or meetups, aim for several mini-conversations that each deliver as much value as a formal hour—without slides or “official pitches.” People often open up more in relaxed contexts.
- Don’t reveal your “motive” immediately. You don’t need to declare you’re doing customer research or have a startup. Start with genuine curiosity about their world. If it resonates, mention your exploration later.
- Embrace serendipity. If you overhear someone complaining about a relevant tool or process, politely jump in with a good question. Many gems come from spontaneous moments.

Informal doesn’t mean sloppy. Still get permission to take notes, be respectful of time, and follow up thoughtfully. If you asked for “a few minutes,” don’t hijack their afternoon unless they want to continue.

Signs you’re being too formal: the person looks uncomfortable, gives short answers, or is eager to leave. In casual modes, you’ll hear anecdotes and see genuine engagement.

Rule of thumb: if it isn’t a formal meeting, you don’t need to justify being there or announce a pitch. Have a good conversation. Honest information will flow.
