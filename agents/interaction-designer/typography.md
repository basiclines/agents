# Typography

Typography shapes readability, tone, and hierarchy in interfaces.

## Key concepts
- Typeface vs. font, families, styles, and variable fonts
- Serif vs. sans, display vs. text, monospace, humanist vs. geometric
- Hierarchy: size, weight, line-height, letter/word spacing, scale
- Legibility vs. readability; contrast, measure (45–75 ch), rhythm
- Systems: type ramps, tokens, responsive type, baseline grids
