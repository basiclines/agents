# Technology & Platforms

Understanding the technology behind interfaces strengthens interaction design. Key topics:

- How Screens Work (Pixels and DPI): CSS pixels are density-independent; high-DPI devices map multiple hardware pixels to one logical pixel. Favor vectors/SVGs or high-res assets; beware sub-pixel lines disappearing. Test across display tech and gamuts.
- Responsive Design and Screen Sizes: Design mobile-first with fluid grids and media queries. Ensure touch target sizes and input modality differences (touch vs mouse/keyboard) are considered. Optimize assets and web fonts for performance.
- SVG and Vector Graphics: Resolution-independent, stylable, and animatable. Prefer SVGs for icons/logos; keep paths clean. Use raster only when vectors are impractical.
- Shaders and Graphics Effects: GPU-accelerated effects (blurs, gradients, distortions). Use judiciously with performance in mind; prefer CSS transforms/opacity for smooth animation.
- Web Tech for Designers (HTML/CSS basics): Know semantic HTML and layout systems (Flexbox/Grid). Understand accessibility basics (roles, focus). Prototype interactions to communicate intent precisely.
- Native Platform Guidelines: Learn HIGs/Material and platform conventions; leverage native components when possible for usability and accessibility.
- Historical Tech Constraints: Recognize origins of patterns (e.g., blue links, pixelated icons) and how modern capabilities enable refined approaches (depth, blur, motion).

Design within constraints while leveraging capabilities. Technological literacy ensures your designs are feasible, performant, and accessible in practice.
