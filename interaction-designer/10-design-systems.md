# Design Systems

The single source of truth for how your product looks and behaves.

- Components, Styles, Tokens: Centralize foundations (color, type, spacing) and components. Understand interrelationships and ripple effects of changes.
- Build vs Use: Start from mature systems (Material/Bootstrap) or craft bespoke as you scale. Audit, rationalize, and document.
- Interrelationships: Unify interaction states (hover, focus, active) and icon style for cohesion; propagate changes via tokens.
- Communication Bridge: Shared vocabulary between design and engineering reduces ambiguity and speeds delivery.
- Maintenance & Governance: Version, test, and review changes. Prevent drift with regular syncs and stewardship.
- Scaling & Theming: Support platform variants and themes via tokens; balance reuse with avoiding unnecessary bloat.
- Example – Forms & Buttons: Align vertical rhythm, heights, and error messaging consistently.

Think “system, not pages.” Invest early; reap consistency, speed, and higher UX quality.
