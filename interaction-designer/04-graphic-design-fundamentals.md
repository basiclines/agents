# Graphic Design Fundamentals

Interaction designers can learn a lot from classic graphic design principles. A famous mnemonic for four core principles is C.R.A.P. â€“ Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity. Key points:

- Contrast: Make important elements stand out by differing from others (color, size, weight, shape). Use contrast deliberately to direct attention and express hierarchy.
- Repetition: Repeat visual elements (heading styles, button patterns, icon style) to create unity and predictability.
- Alignment: Nothing should look randomly placed. Align to shared edges/baselines for order and professionalism; avoid subtle misalignments.
- Proximity: Group related items, separate unrelated ones. Use spacing to communicate information architecture and improve scannability.

Beyond CRAP, remember balance, rhythm, and focus. Study strong examples to see these in action. Break principles only with intent; in product UI, clarity and usability come first.
