# Visual Design Rules

Heuristics you can safely apply in most cases to improve aesthetics and usability:

- Use Near-Black and Near-White, Not Pure Black/White: On screens, very dark gray on off-white is easier on the eyes than stark #000/#FFF while maintaining excellent readability.
- Saturate Neutrals Slightly: Tint grays with a touch of brand hue (2–5% saturation) for cohesion. Keep neutral tints consistently warm or cool.
- High Contrast for Important, Low for Secondary: Give primary actions and headings strong contrast. Keep structural elements subtle to avoid competing for attention.
- Every Element Should Have a Purpose: Remove arbitrary decoration. Maximize signal-to-noise; design with clear intent.
- Prefer Optical Alignment When Needed: Trust the eye to nudge shapes or icons for perceived balance when math-centered looks off.
- Scale Spacing with Element Size: Larger text/UI often needs proportionally tighter line/letter-spacing; very small elements may need more spacing for clarity.
- Borders and Dividers: Ensure sufficient contrast and appropriate weight. Sometimes spacing alone suffices; when used, keep lines subtle except for focus states.
- Align by Visual Weight: Order or place elements to avoid lopsided layouts; consider icon fills and label lengths.
- Grid Columns – 12 Is a Safe Bet: A 12-column grid provides flexible responsive layouts (halves, thirds, quarters, sixths) with consistent gutters.
- Measure Spacing from High-Contrast Points: Space blocks by their perceived edges, not arbitrary container padding, for consistent visual gaps.
- Layering: Foreground layers often appear lighter than background; follow platform elevation conventions (light mode and dark mode).
- Shadows and Blurs: As a starting point, set blur ≈ 2× offset for natural softness; tune opacity and color for context.

Use these rules as defaults and adjust based on context, accessibility, and platform norms. Create a quick review checklist to audit designs against them.
