# Human Behavior & Psychology

Design for how people actually think and behave—ethically.

- Cognitive Biases & Heuristics: Anchoring, availability, social proof, loss aversion, Hick’s Law, Miller’s Law, Peak‑End Rule. Leverage to aid decisions, avoid dark patterns.
- Research Methods: Interviews, usability testing, surveys, analytics, A/B tests, field studies. Pick methods per question; mix qual + quant.
- Behavioral Design & Persuasion: Use nudges responsibly for user-benefiting outcomes.
- Mental Models: Match conceptual models to users’ expectations; use clear terminology; support error recovery and recognition over recall.
- Emotional & Social Factors: Use tone, microcopy, and subtle delight to build trust and engagement; consider cultural differences.
- Cognitive Load: Reduce memory/decision effort via defaults, progressive disclosure, and strong visual hierarchy.
- Bias in Research: Guard against participant and researcher biases; use neutral prompts and triangulate findings.

Center empathy, clarity, and ethics to craft intuitive and respectful experiences.
