# Chapter 8: Running the Process

Bring it all together with a lightweight cadence across three phases: preparation, execution, and follow-up.

Figure: Customer-conversation process (before, during, after). Before: identify who to talk to, contact with the right framing, and prepare your top 3 questions. During: apply the Mom Test rules, take solid notes, and—when appropriate—ask for a commitment. After: debrief with your team, extract conclusions, update hypotheses/questions, and store learnings permanently.

Preparation (before the conversation)

- Know who you’re talking to and why. Tie this to segmentation and prospecting. Do small background research and craft a clear framing that centers their experience: “I’m exploring how [people like you] handle [problem X]. Could we chat for 15 minutes about your current process?”
- Have your top 3 questions ready. Write them down. This keeps you focused on critical risks and gives you courage to ask the hard stuff.
- Light logistics: confirm place/medium, minimize friction.
- Note-taking ready: notebook/app, permission to record if applicable. Use simple symbols (e.g., 💰 for money, 😩 for pain, ⭐ for verbatim quote).

Execution (during)

- Open with brief context that reinforces you’re there to learn, not to pitch. Start broad: “What’s the hardest part of Y?”
- Apply the three rules continuously: their life, past specifics, listen more than you speak. If you slip into pitching, catch yourself and steer back.
- Take diligent notes, especially numbers and verbatim phrases. Consider a two-person approach: one leads, one notes.
- Follow the energy: probe where they show depth or emotion. Separate priorities from nice-to-haves.
- Track your top 3; weave them in at the right moments.
- If appropriate, ask for a next step (commitment). If they aren’t a buyer, ask for referrals.

Follow-up (after)

- Review notes ASAP with your team. Share the story and highlight quotes/data. Centralize insights.
- Use customer words to align internally; quotes beat interpretations.
- Update hypotheses and your top 3 questions based on what changed. Decide: build, iterate, talk to more of the same, or switch segments.
- Organize notes so they’re permanent and searchable (docs, Notion, spreadsheet, cards). Transcribe paper notes quickly.
- Avoid the single-keeper anti-pattern: don’t trap learning in one person’s head. Debrief and share.

Decide clear next steps: Do we have enough evidence to build X? Do we need 5 more interviews? What are the next top 3 questions? If surprising findings emerge, reflect them in your plan—don’t ignore data that contradicts your narrative.

Sustained practice: Customer conversations aren’t a one-off task. Great teams keep a lightweight loop of talk → learn → decide → build → repeat. Run towards the truth and let it guide your product.
