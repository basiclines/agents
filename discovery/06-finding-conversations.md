# Chapter 6: Finding Conversations

Where do you find people to talk to—especially if you don’t yet have customers? Combine proactive outreach with pull-based tactics.

If you are part of the target market yourself, start with your network: colleagues, friends, communities, forums. The Mom Test protects you even with friends, as long as you ask good questions.

If you don’t know your customers yet, hustle:

1) Going to them. Find prospects where they already are—physical spaces (stores, conferences) and digital spaces (forums, LinkedIn groups, social channels). Ask: “Where do people with this problem hang out?” Expect cold outreach: email, calls, DMs, in-person intros. Early rejection rates are high and meaningless. You only need a few good conversations to trigger referrals and warm intros. Don’t limit yourself to a single channel; test many. Consider travel if ROI is high.

2) Bringing them to you. Attract interest so people contact you: publish helpful content about the problem, share insights, answer questions in communities, host small roundtables. Use an “advisory flip”: ask industry experts for advice, not a sale. Treat them as experts; if they see your seriousness, they may help with intros—or become early customers themselves.

Always multiply conversations: end each call with “Who else should I talk to?” The seven degrees of Kevin Bacon apply—keep asking and you’ll reach the right people. If you can’t clearly say who and where your customers are, your segment definition is still too broad; slice it smaller until you can.

Mindset: The goal is to learn fast, not to collect social approval. Be respectful and honest in your approach; enough people will help if you ask well.
