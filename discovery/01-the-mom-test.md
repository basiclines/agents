# Chapter 1: The Mom Test

The core idea is simple: don’t ask people whether your business idea is good. If you do, most will give polite or imprecise answers to avoid hurting your feelings—especially your mom, who will “lie” out of love. The Mom Test instead teaches you to ask questions in a way that even a loving mother can’t help but tell you the truth.

To do that, Rob Fitzpatrick proposes three simple rules:

- Rule 1: Talk about the customer’s life, not your idea. Instead of “Do you like my idea X?”, focus on how they currently handle the problem you want to solve. For example: “How do you handle [the problem] today?” You’ll get factual experience, not opinions about an imaginary product.
- Rule 2: Ask about specific past behavior, not future hypotheticals. Avoid “Would you buy something that does X?” People often say yes in theory but don’t act later. Better: “When was the last time you faced [this problem], and what did you do?” Past behavior is real data; future promises are optimistic lies—even if unintentional.
- Rule 3: Listen more, talk less. If you monopolize the conversation pitching your idea, you bias the answers and learn nothing new. Let the customer talk about their problems and context; you’re there to understand, not to sell. Ask open-ended questions, then be quiet and listen attentively.

Figure: Summary of the 3 Mom Test rules. On the left, avoid seeking approval (“Do you like my idea?”), future hypotheticals (“Would you use it if it existed?”), or leading questions (“Wouldn’t this be great?”). On the right, ask about customer reality: “How did you solve X last time?”, “What’s the hardest part of Y?”, “Have you ever paid to solve this?”

Why it matters: these rules surface honest information. Consider the example that gives the book its name. You have an idea for an “iPad recipe book” and want to validate it with your mother.

- Wrong conversation (fails the Mom Test): “I’m building a recipes app for iPad—would you like it? It’ll only cost $40!” Mom replies: “Oh, that sounds nice—of course I’d love it.” Maybe she adds “Keep me posted.” You walk away thinking there’s a market. In reality, you learned nothing—your question invited a polite lie.
- Right conversation (passes the Mom Test): You ask about her life: “I see a lot of cookbooks on your shelf—how did you get them?” She says: “Honestly, most were gifts; I rarely buy cookbooks myself.” That’s valuable: this experienced home cook doesn’t usually buy cookbooks. You continue: “What was the last cookbook you bought and why?” Maybe she says she bought a niche vegan one three months ago for healthier ideas. Then: “Do you use a tablet in the kitchen?” She might say: “No, it’s awkward; I prefer paper notes.” Now you have facts: she doesn’t use an iPad to cook and seldom buys cookbooks except for very specific needs. You may conclude a generic iPad recipe book won’t resonate with this segment, or it must be much more targeted.

In the second conversation, Mom can’t “lie” because you never asked for her opinion of your idea; you asked about her real behavior. That difference is massive: the first chat gives false confidence; the second provides actionable insight about problem, segment, and context.

Bottom line: never ask “Do you like my idea/business?” Apply the 3 rules instead—talk about their problems and behaviors, dig into concrete past examples, and listen actively. You’ll get honest information that saves time, money, and disappointment. As the book says, it’s our responsibility to find the truth; it’s not others’ job to deliver it to us.
