# Chapter 5: Commitment & Advancement

At some point, learning alone isn’t enough—you need evidence they’d actually use or pay. That’s where commitment and advancement come in.

A successful conversation yields a concrete commitment or a clear next step. Otherwise you risk living in “this is interesting—let’s keep in touch” land, which doesn’t validate your business. In sales terms, each interaction should advance the relationship. A commitment is when the customer gives up something they value—time, reputation, or money—for your project.

Types of early commitments:

- Time commitments: Book a follow-up, review a mockup, invite teammates to a demo, agree to a pilot timeline. Real calendar time beats “Sure, keep me posted.”
- Reputation commitments: Make an intro to a colleague or boss, endorse you, provide a testimonial. People don’t risk their name on something they don’t believe has potential.
- Financial commitments: Letter of intent, pre-order, deposit, early paid pilot. Putting money down is the strongest validation.

Sometimes one action covers multiple types, e.g., “We’ll run a paid 1-month pilot with the team.”

How to get commitments: You usually need to ask. Shift from passive learning to active validation when appropriate. If a conversation is going well, don’t leave without proposing the next step. Convert nice words into actions—or force a polite maybe to reveal itself as a no.

Example: Prospect says, “I like it—let me know when it’s ready.” You say: “Great! We’re running a closed beta next month. We can include 5 companies and would need someone on your team to configure it during the trial. Interested?” If they are serious, they’ll accept and schedule. If not, they’ll hedge. Either outcome is valuable.

This isn’t about arm-twisting. You’re not being aggressive—you’re cutting through goodbye niceties. If they aren’t interested, a clear no is a gift. If they are, they’ll appreciate a concrete next step.

Principles:

- “If you leave a meeting without knowing what happens next, it was a useless meeting.” Always define the next step.
- “The more they give up, the more seriously you can take their nice words.” Deeds validate words.
- Ask for the right-size commitment for the stage you’re in. Early: intro to a colleague. Later: pilot, LOI, payment. Turn promises into actions immediately—schedule, send agreements, confirm stakeholders.

You can even salvage a weak meeting by asking for a commitment at the end: “Before we wrap, is there any way we could continue? Perhaps someone on your team who’s closer to this, or would you consider trying a pilot when ready?” You’ll get either a useful no or a path forward.

In very early stages, your primary goal is still learning—revenue is a byproduct. Asking for commitments helps you learn the real intensity of the problem and surface objections that only appear when moving from talk to action.

Bottom line: turn conversations into actions. Aim for a tangible yes or a clear no.
