# Chapter 3: Asking Important Questions

Once you know how to avoid biasing your conversations, you must decide what to ask. Friendly chats about trivialities won’t help. Focus on questions that address your biggest business risks.

Before every conversation, prepare a short list—ideally the 3 most important questions you need answered. Ask: “What, if confirmed or refuted, would significantly change our plan?” Those are your priority questions. Discuss with your team and keep an updated top-3 list of uncertainties about product, market, or model.

Your “big three” varies by project and person. With end users, ask how they currently solve the problem and how painful it is (problem/market risk). With buyers/decision makers, ask about budget and purchasing processes (pricing/channel risk). With a potential partner, your questions differ. Tailor to the interlocutor, but always know what matters most for this meeting.

Don’t dodge hard questions because you fear bad news. If none of your questions make you a bit nervous, you’re likely avoiding the elephant in the room. Founders often shy away from money questions—fatal mistake. Don’t ask hypotheticals like “Would you pay $100?” Ask: “Have you bought something to solve this before? How much did you spend?” or “How do you allocate budget for X today?” That yields real viability signals.

Example: you sell edtech to public schools and fear they have no budget. Ask: “How did you acquire your last technology tool? Was it funded, donated, or grant-based?” If many say “We have no tech budget unless it’s donated,” that’s a strong signal to rethink your model or segment. Another crucial question: “What is the biggest pain teachers face with current tools?” This reveals whether you’re targeting something that matters.

Keep your top three in mind during the conversation. Be flexible—follow unexpected but promising threads. If a question gets answered organically, great. If a question is consistently answered across interviews, you might drop it from future chats and move to the next risk.

Update your questions as you learn. Early on, you may focus on problem existence and frequency. Once confirmed, shift to solution shape, willingness to pay, discovery, and buying process. Iterate toward reducing maximum uncertainty.

When possible, observe real behavior. People’s self-reports differ from reality. Contextual inquiry—watching someone do the work—reveals true pain and inefficiencies. “Seeing someone perform their job shows where the problems are—not where they think they are.”

Seize serendipity. If you bump into someone from your ideal segment, don’t waste it with small talk. Ask one important question on the spot. For example, building for professional speakers? “How did you get this speaking gig—were you contacted or did you pursue it?” Such a simple, relevant opener can spark a rich, informal learning conversation.

Golden rules: “If you don’t know what you want to learn, don’t bother having the conversation.” And: “Always have your top 3 questions.” With preparation, courage to ask the hard stuff, and adaptability, every conversation moves you closer to reality.
