# Chapter 7: Choosing Your Customers

Startups rarely die of starvation; they die of indigestion—trying to serve too many directions at once. In hindsight, great companies look universal, but most began with a specific niche before expanding. Starting too broad dilutes your message and product; you fully solve no one’s problem.

Problems with a vague customer definition:

1) Overwhelm. Infinite choices, no idea where to start.
2) No progress, no refutation. Mixed feedback: you never get a strong no to pivot nor a strong yes to commit.
3) Confusing signals. Talking to many disparate users yields irreconcilable data.

Illustrative story: a founder built a nutritious sweet powder that could serve many markets—moms, athletes, restaurants. She ran in circles: each segment wanted different formats and benefits. Once she focused on “moms with young kids who shop at small health-food stores,” she could test quickly by asking store owners for a tiny shelf trial—both a reputation and time commitment. Within a week she got clear signals from sell-through or specific feedback. Focus unlocked progress.

How to choose a first segment:

- Pain: Choose those who feel the problem intensely. They’ll forgive MVP rough edges.
- Access: Pick a segment you can reach. Define it so you know exactly where to find them.
- Homogeneity: Within-segment customers should share problems and goals. If 5 interviews yield unrelated needs, the segment is still too broad.
- Adjacency: Prefer niches whose problems recur in nearby segments, enabling later expansion.

Say no (for now) to off-segment opportunities that derail focus. A giant but off-fit customer can sink early traction by pulling you into incompatible requirements. You can always pivot deliberately if evidence warrants; just avoid serving multiple divergent segments simultaneously at the start.

Rules of thumb:

- “If you don’t know exactly who your customers are and where to find them, your segment isn’t defined enough.”
- “Keep talking until you stop hearing new things” for that segment—then build/iterate or switch.
- “Before serving everyone, serve a few incredibly well.”
