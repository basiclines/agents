# Chapter 2: Avoiding Bad Data

When you start talking to customers, the risk isn’t only that they’ll be polite—it’s also that you’ll misinterpret what you hear. The Mom Test warns about three common types of “bad data” that lead to wrong conclusions:

1) Empty compliments. “I love it, sounds great.” Easy to get because people want to be nice, but useless. Compliments are fool’s gold: they sparkle, distract, and are worth nothing for learning. If you pitched too soon, people will tell you what they think you want to hear.

2) Fluff (future hypotheticals). Vague statements like “Yeah, I might use something like that someday.” These include promises—“I’d totally buy it if it existed”—and enthusiastic opinions with no evidence. Everything about the future is optimistic fiction. Opinions without actions are low-reliability data.

3) Unsolicited ideas and feature requests. Instead of describing their problems, people tell you how to build your product: “You should add feature X.” Customers know their problems, but not necessarily the right solution. Understand underlying needs; don’t blindly obey suggestions.

Even if you follow the rules, compliments, hypotheticals, and feature ideas will pop up. The key is to steer back to solid ground:

- Don’t fish for compliments. Avoid approval-seeking questions like “Do you like it?” They beg for polite praise. If someone says “Sounds fantastic, I love the idea,” deflect gracefully: “Thanks! Quick one: in your current process, how do you handle X?” Ignore the “I love it” and return to facts.

- Anchor vagueness and hypotheticals. When you hear “I sometimes have that problem” or “I’d probably be interested,” ask for specifics: “Can you tell me about the last time? What did you do then?” If they claim they’d use it in the future, ask: “What have you already tried? What was the last thing you tried and how did it go?” Convert fluff into concrete examples or discover the problem barely exists. Avoid “Would you use this?” Better: “Have you ever paid to solve this? How much, and what was that experience?”

- Investigate the why behind feature ideas. If they propose “Please add an option to do X,” don’t promise. Ask: “Why would you want that? What would you try to achieve with it?” That reveals the real pain (“so I don’t have to do Y manually”). You might solve that pain differently—and better—than the suggested feature.

Example of going wrong vs right: You pitch “It’s Uber Eats for offices with AI…” The prospect says, “Interesting, I like it.” You continue, “It will cut costs by 35%.” They say, “Sounds excellent—let me know when it’s ready.” You leave thinking you’ve got validation. In reality: no commitments, no learning—just nice words. Months later, they ghost you.

Handled well: After the first quick “I love it,” you pivot: “I jumped ahead. How do you currently handle [the problem]?” They describe their real workflow: “We use a spreadsheet and tons of emails—huge headache.” You go deeper: “Why a spreadsheet? What’s hardest about that?” Now you get actionable facts: five hours a week lost, multiple tools tried, known constraints. If at the end they say, “If this actually saves time, we’d consider paying,” that’s meaningful.

Takeaway: Don’t be fooled by pretty words or ambiguous chatter. Facts beat a thousand compliments. A lukewarm or negative comment is more useful than an enthusiastic but empty one—there’s more truth in a “meh” than in a “wow.” Treat every compliment or future promise as a red flag. Probe, anchor to specifics, or ask for a small commitment (see Chapter 5). The market—not opinions—decides.
